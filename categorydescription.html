    <h3>CACTUS PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Cacti are plants that have succulent stems, pads or branches with scales and spines instead of leaves.
    Cactus plants are actually modified stems with a waxy coating. The prickly spines are modified leaves that break up the evaporative winds blowing across pad surfaces, 
    and help shade the stem. Most cacti only need to be watered every two to three weeks, making them very easy to care for. Cacti thrive in dry soil that drains well. 
    Too much moisture can cause root rot, causing decay and even death of the plant. Root rot is a common issue that beginners struggle with. </p>
    <h3>FLOWERING PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Flowering plants are plants that bear flowers and fruits, and form angiosperms. Maintain Proper Humidity. 
    The air in your home can be drier in the winter, which can stress your plants. Protect Flowering Plants From Cold Winds.
    Keep your plants away from cold winds from windows and doors.</p>
    <h3>SUCCULENT PLANTS</h3>
    <p>succulent plants, also known as succulents, are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged, usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions.
    Unlike their cactus kin, succulents cannot take extreme heat. Succulents do best with moderate temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees,
    so put them by a window indoors, or outdoors on a covered patio or beneath trees in the summer. Freezing temperatures will kill them, which is why for most of us they are houseplants.</p>
    <h3>BONSAI PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Bonsai are trees and plants grown in containers in such a way so that they look their most beautiful – even prettier
    than those growing in the wild. Cultivating bonsai, therefore, is a very artistic hobby as well as a traditional Japanese art. Bonsai trees are planted in small pots with minimal space for water and nutrient reserves.
    That means you need to water and fertilize your tree regularly. Make sure your Bonsai gets plenty of light, water, and fertilize when needed and your tree is sure to thrive! </p>
    <h3>CREEPER PLANT</h3>
    <p>Creepers, as the name suggests, are plants that creep on the ground. They have very fragile, long, thin stems that can neither
    stand erect nor support all their weight. Examples include watermelon, strawberry, pumpkin and sweet potatoes. Light, Curtain creeper plants require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Watering, 
    Curtain creeper plants require regular watering to keep the soil moist but not soggy. 
    Soil, Curtain creeper plants require well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. Use Fertilizers and prune regular intervals</p>
    <h3>OUTDOOR PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Plants that need low maintenance and grow up easily on the outside are known as Outdoor plants. 
    Water your plants in the morning. Use a light much. Use shade covers. Avoid over watering your garden. 
    Weed your garden regularly. Still waters run deep Prevent water from stagnating, whether on the soil or pots and trays </p>
    <h3>CLIMBER PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Climbers are plants with a tender stem which grow with the help of external support. These plants produce a twine or hook from their leaves to climb. Naturally, climbing plants require maintenance and trimming! 
    First comes an establishment phase: the plant is guided on its support during initial growth. After the plant reaches the desired coverage area, regular maintenance is then required to sustain the plant and its form.</p>
    <h3>MEDICINAL PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Medicinal plants are used worldwide as an alternative or a complementary medicine. Treatment with herbal medicinal plants also hold a strong ground because these plants are considered to be safe and have no side effects. 
    Since they are in sync with nature, they hold greater advantage over chemically treated products and synthetic medicines.</p>
    <h3>INDOOR PLANTS</h3>
    <p>Plants that require a low amount of light and water to thrive are typically known as indoor plants. Make a schedule of taking each plant out for a few days every 8 to 10 weeks.
    Since we see indoor plants very often, sometimes there develops
    a pattern of watering them frequently even when the soil does not require any extra moisture. Believe it or not, overwatering is the number one cause for plants dying</p>
    <h3>HANGING PLANTS</h3>
    <p>A plant that grows downwards or hangs, often from a hanging basket or a high surface. Water regularly, keeping in mind that potted plants tend to dry out more quickly than plants in the ground, but avoid overwatering your hanging baskets. Fertilize as needed, following the plant species feeding recommendations. Deadhead (remove spent blooms) flowering plants to encourage further blooming.</p>
